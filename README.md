<h6> ANALYSE THE RESULTS </h6>
How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?
These results show my strengths and weaknesses that could potentially influence my behavior in a team. Personally, I agree with most of the outcomes of these test. I am very bold and practical however I do struggle keeping on top of everything and having to be able to provide my solutions on time. The Myers-Briggs test shows that I can be unfocused, which is partially accurate. I do happen to lose track of the work that needs to be completed.

How should you take this into account when forming a team?
I should be cautious of my actions when in a team so I can keep on track and provide the best output I can. As I have stated these tests display my strengths and weaknesses and the best learning method. I can consider my learning method and embrace that concept whilst also focusing on my weaknesses to better myself. Also, with my strengths I could use that to my advantage as well whilst in a team.
