<h1><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION:</b></h1>

<p>
Welcome all to my website!
Firstly, I’ll start by introducing and providing basic information about myself. My name is Ceren Buyuksu (student ID S3817416) and I’m a currently enrolled IT student. My nationality originates from Turkey since previous generations were born and raised in Turkey, however I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia.
Although Turkish is my native language, my ability to speak fluently in Turkish has decreased due to the years of consistently speaking English and focusing less on my native language. Whilst I’m not as good as I used to be, I can convey a conversation and still communicate my message through to the other person. In terms of culture, I attempt to keep a balance between the Turkish and Australian culture.
My education to date, is the following:
 - VCE 2017 – Completed
 - Certificate 3 & 4 in Interactive media 2017 - Completed
 - Diploma of Information Technology 2018 – Incomplete
 - Bachelor of Information Technology 2019 – Enrolled
If you have any questions regarding my work, email me through the following email: ceren_buyuksu@hotmail.com 


<h6> INTERESTING FACT! </h6>
I despise horror movies but enjoy watching gruesome films. Films such as Saw, The Human Centipede are things that interest me. Even though both genres can base on true stories, horror creates this concept or idea that I won’t be able to protect myself from the spiritual realm if positioned in the character’s state in the movie. 
For example, if a serial killer kidnapped me, I would have solutions I can alternate between so that I have a leeway for escape. However, with a demon you can only do so much physically. From my perspective, physical solutions can be a better way to have an increased chance of escaping rather than relying on others assistance.


<h6> HOBBIES: </h6>
A few interests that I have include seeing films, exploring, dancing and/or making creative art. Recently I haven’t been able to focus on my hobbies due to prioritizing university studies and work.

<h6> INTEREST IN IT: </h6>
Personally, I have a few reasons as to why I’m curious and interested about IT. IT has a wide range of matters concerning the aspects of managing and processing information. In addition, IT consistently develops and evolves within today’s society. This concept or theory of IT inspires and interests me to further explore the IT community. In saying so, there are going to be many issues that arise which need to be solved thus allowing troubleshooting to come into the equation. Troubleshooting is one reason as to why I’ve decided to pursue IT. Since I like to help other people with fixable issues, troubleshooting is a great way to aid people when requested. However, there are other fields and concepts that interest me as well.
Although I was using technology prior to studying technology in high school my interest grew further whilst studying it. The moment that I knew that I wanted to pursue IT as a career or that I had an interest in  IT was when I was given the option to complete a VCE subject. Since IT was one of my favorite subjects, I knew it was the VCE subject that I wanted to complete. So, I pursed on with my studies in the technology sector. With the assistance and the motivation of my teacher for that subject, I completed my studies successfully and moved on to studying my bachelors. 
Currently I have no IT experience but would love to gain some experience through internships

Transferring from Victoria University to RMIT has been a major change. The reason behind transferring was the fact that I was not learning much from the classes and the way the block mode system was set up and how the units were presented. I transferred to RMIT because its been said that RMIT is good for IT and the fact that this is an online course as well meaning that I could work full time. Those are the major factors have helped me to decide to transfer into RMIT.
During my studies at RMIT I expect to learn rather than base my skills off memory and not aim to just pass my studies. Other than my grades, I hope to create connections with the students and tutors at RMIT. But most importantly I aim to successfully complete my bachelor’s degree and maybe move on to a master’s degree.
