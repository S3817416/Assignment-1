<h6> DESCRIPTTION OF JOB </h6>
This position is looking for an individual with outstanding problem-solving skills who is passionate about maintaining LMI Group’s engine room whilst also providing great customer service. It is a service desk position. The daily requirements are to assist in resolving helpdesk requests and to determine the urgency of requests. This position is appealing to me because I get to help people with their issues through troubleshooting and also target my motivation to continue in the IT sector.
The skills and qualifications needed for this position requires the following criteria:
- Tertiary qualification in IT or related disciplines
- 3 years’ experience as a level 2 ICT service desk
- Good analytical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Common sense and initiative
- Business awareness
- Tenacity
- Strategic thinking
- Positive approach to change
- Legal rights to live and work in Australia

The skills and qualifications I currently have are the following:
- Good analytical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Common sense and initiative
- Business awareness
- Tenacity
- Strategic thinking
- Positive approach to change
- Legal rights to live and work in Australia
However, once I have completed this course, I will also be able to fit into the first criteria. My plan in achieving such position would be to firstly complete this course successfully and have an internship during my second and last year as a level 1 or 2 ICT service desk officer and then work my way up until I’m satisfied with the results and where I have gotten. After I have gained the minimum years of experience needed to attain this position, I would then apply to this company.
